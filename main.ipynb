    "# Introduction: Solving the 2D Poisson Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Physical and Mathematical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Poisson equation** is a fundamental partial differential equation (PDE) used across physics and engineering to describe how a field (like electric potential or temperature) behaves in the presence of a source (like electric charge or heat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In two dimensions, the equation for electric potential $V$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 V = \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} = -\\frac{\\rho(x,y)}{\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **$\\nabla^2$ (The Laplacian):** Represents the \"curvature\" or spatial second derivative of the potential.\n",
    "*   **$\\rho(x,y)$:** The charge density (the source). In this project, we use a specific Gaussian distribution: \n",
    "    $$\\rho(x,y) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)$$\n",
    "*   **$\\epsilon$:** The permittivity of the medium (assumed to be 1.0 for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the source term $\\rho$ is zero, the equation is known as the **Laplace equation**, which describes the potential in a region \"empty\" of charges:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Boundary Conditions (BCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a unique solution within a square domain $\\Omega$, we must define what happens at the edges $\\partial \\Omega$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Dirichlet Boundary Conditions:** We explicitly set the value of the potential $V$ at the edge. Here, we use sinusoidal functions (controlled by parameters $A$ through $D$) to simulate varying potentials along the four walls:\n",
    "    $$V(x, y) = f(x, y) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad (x, y) \\in \\partial \\Omega$$\n",
    "2.  **Neumann Boundary Conditions:** We set the *gradient* (slope) of the potential. For example, setting $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n} = 0$ on the right boundary simulates an insulating or reflective boundary:\n",
    "    $$\\nabla V \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n} = g(x, y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Numerical Approach: Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the Poisson equation numerically, we transform the continuous partial differential equation into a discrete system of algebraic equations. This process is known as the **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Discretization of the Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the continuous $xy$-plane as a grid (or mesh) of points. If the square domain has length $L$, we divide it into $N$ intervals along each axis, resulting in a grid spacing $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\Delta x = \\Delta y = \\frac{L}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A point in the domain is now identified by integer indices $(i, j)$, where the coordinates are:\n",
    "$$x_i = i \\cdot h, \\quad y_j = j \\cdot h$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous potential $V(x,y)$ is transformed into a discrete matrix $V_{i,j}$, where each entry represents the potential value at a specific grid node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Finite Difference Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the second-order derivatives $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2}$, we use the **Taylor Series expansion**. By combining the forward and backward expansions, we derive the **Central Difference Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{V_{i+1,j} - 2V_{i,j} + V_{i-1,j}}{h^2}$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} \\approx \\frac{V_{i,j+1} - 2V_{i,j} + V_{i,j-1}}{h^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting these into the Poisson equation ($\\nabla^2 V = -\\rho/\\epsilon$) gives the **Five-Point Stencil**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_{i+1,j} + V_{i-1,j} + V_{i,j+1} + V_{i,j-1} - 4V_{i,j}}{h^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_{i,j}}{\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) From Algebra to Iterative Schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "If we solve the stencil equation for the central point $V_{i,j}$, we find that the potential at any point is the average of its four neighbors plus a correction for the local charge density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( V_{i+1,j} + V_{i-1,j} + V_{i,j+1} + V_{i,j-1} + \\frac{h^2 \\rho_{i,j}}{\\epsilon} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every point depends on its neighbors, we cannot solve for $V_{i,j}$ directly in one step. Instead, we use the **Gauss-Seidel** approach, where we sweep through the grid and update values using the most recent data available:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{i,j}^{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( V_{i+1,j}^{\\text{old}} + V_{i-1,j}^{\\text{new}} + V_{i,j+1}^{\\text{old}} + V_{i,j-1}^{\\text{new}} + \\frac{h^2 \\rho_{i,j}}{\\epsilon} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method accelerates convergence by looking at the \"residual\" (the difference between the current value and the calculated target) and amplifying the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the update as a weighted average between the old value and the Gauss-Seidel target using a relaxation factor $\\omega$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{i,j}^{(k+1)} = (1 - \\omega)V_{i,j}^{(k)} + \\omega V_{i,j}^{\\text{GS target}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **If $\\omega = 1$:** The method is identical to Gauss-Seidel.\n",
    "*   **If $1 < \\omega < 2$ (Over-relaxation):** The algorithm pushes the value further than the local average suggests, which effectively \"propagates\" information across the grid much faster.\n",
    "*   **Optimal $\\omega$:** For a square grid of size $N$, the optimal value is approximately:\n",
    "    $$\\omega_{\\text{opt}} \\approx \\frac{2}{1 + \\sin(\\pi/N)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Convergence Criteria and Energy Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical solver iterates until the system reaches a steady state. We monitor the **Energy Functional ($J$)**, which represents the total energy stored in the electrostatic field:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J[V] = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} |\\nabla V|^2 - \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}V \\right] dx dy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discrete version, the algorithm stops when the change in $V$ between two iterations (the $L_\\infty$ norm of the residual) falls below a predefined tolerance:\n",
    "$$\\max |V_{i,j}^{(k+1)} - V_{i,j}^{(k)}| < \\text{tol}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) vs. Numerical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This project compares the traditional **SOR method** against a modern machine learning approach: **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature        | Numerical (SOR)                   | PINNs (Deep Learning)                          |\n",
    "| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Space**      | Discrete grid (Nodes)             | Continuous domain                              |\n",
    "| **Mechanism**  | Iterative local updates           | Loss function minimization via Backpropagation |\n",
    "| **Physics**    | Hard-coded via finite differences | Embedded in the Neural Network's Loss Function |\n",
    "| **Efficiency** | Very fast for simple 2D grids     | Slower training, but mesh-free and scalable    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The PINN minimizes a composite loss function $\\mathcal{L}$:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{residual} + \\mathcal{L}_{BC}$$\n",
    "Where the residual loss enforces the physics:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{residual} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left| \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{V}}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{V}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon} \\right|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the **Potential $V$** and the **Residual $R$** (how much the solution fails to satisfy the original equation), we can determine the accuracy and reliability of neural networks in solving classical electrostatic problems compared to time-tested numerical solvers."
